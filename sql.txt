SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

OrderDetails includes: OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity

Products includes:
ProductID, ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, Unit, Price

SELECT OrderDetails.OrderID, Products.ProductName, OrderDetails.Quantity FROM OrderDetails INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;

Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

Orders includes: OrderID, CustomerID, EmployeeID, OrderDate, ShipperID

OrderDetails includes: OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity

Employees includes: EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName, BirthDate, Photo, Notes

SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, OrderDetails.ProductID, OrderDetails.Quantity FROM OrderDetails 
    INNER JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
    INNER JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
